# Diversity in the Web Development Community
An initiative to publish information, raw data, and insights on the diversity
of the web world based on a community-drafted survey, hoping to increase
visibility about existing under-representation and encourage conversations about
increasing diversity.

Authored by the community, at
https://github.com/drnikki/diversity-survey

## Goals
* 10,000 unique responses
* 1,000 Github stars
* 100 Collaborators

## WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW

* People to support (tweet, star on github)
* People interested in helping author (github PRs, issues)
* Companies with email lists willing to support and promote the survey (when ready)

## Survey Participants:
Anyone who identifies with ‘moving the web forward’ or ‘making the internet’.
This includes roles like sysadmin, project manager, shop owner, designer, UX,
etc.  Possible problems: skewing the data with ‘content editors’ or ‘copywriters’

## Timeline
Here's what we're hoping to do:

* May '16: Organize
* June '16: Draft and release survey
* July '16: Wait for results, promote
* August '16: Collect results, publish, event to analyze
* September '16: DrupalCon Dublin: Presentation

## Methods
* Draft Survey
* Put Survey structure on github for collaboration
* Look at similar surveys from government, other industries,
* Get feedback, particularly on if the questions are good, i.e. not ‘leading’ and questions which are not binary have the right input options
* Should we model survey structure after existing survey - like census
* Run Survey, probably for ~ 1 month
* Collection method, tbd. Google forms can export straight to csv.
* Publish Results
* CSVs on github
* Analyze Results
* Present at DrupalCon Dublin
* (possibly) Propose recommendations for Drupal Association

## Potential Allies
* Pantheon (Nick Stielau)
* Academic qualitative researchers (Nikki to contact)

## Potential Comparisons / Dimensions
* Role (PM, Dev, Owner, TPM, etc)
* Size of company (0-20, 21-50, 51-150?)
* Web shop, ad agency, internal dev team
* Vertical: higher-ed, non-profit, tech, media, etc
* Location
* Language
* Religion
* LGBT
* Education Background
* Disabilities
* Age
* Relationship status?
* Children?
* Does employee retention/tenure correlate to diversity
* Does management's activity in diversity correlate with employee rentention?
* Does having a strong mission correct with increased diversity?


## Simple ways to Fail:
* Not doing it at all
* No one is leading/driving it
* Leading/biased questions
* Data Integrity issues (i.e. multiple responses from same person)

## How to Contribute
* Star the github repo to show your support!
* Tweet/reweet to help promote!
* Fork and PR!
* Contact @drnikki or @nstielau
* Simply have converstations about diversity, why it's important, and how we can improve it!

## Oops! / Ouch! Policy
Talking about diversity can be hard, but we believe talking is first step for
improvement.  As such, we need some room to make mistakes, and to give clear
feedback when a discussion/approach/idea/term is hurtful.  Say 'Oops!' if you
catch yourself on potentially offensive territory, and 'Ouch!' if you feel
offended.  Thanks!

## Next Steps:
* Find survey drafters and reviewers
* Find organizations that will distribute to their mailing lists
* June 15, 4pm PST next meeting.
